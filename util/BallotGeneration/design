voter proceeds to the polling booth and selects the candidate. 
A commitment will be generated corresponding to the vote using randomness r_vote.
(Note that the ballot which contains obfuscation token is not used yet)
(So the commitment to be generated will be index based and not w_m)

The voter matches the w(m) on the EVM printout receipt against the one next to her candidate in her ballot. She also
checks the clear text vote on the VVPR slip. If the voter is satisfied with the EVM printout receipt as well as
the VVPR slip, she presses OK button; otherwise she presses Error, following which similar steps as Protocol I are taken.
